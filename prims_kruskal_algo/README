1.Driver program is written in main.cpp
2.Input we are taking from a file named input_graph.txt
3.Here we are implimenting two algorithms (prims, kruskal) code for them is written in prim.cpp and kruskal.cpp
4.Graph data structure is implimented in graph.cpp, similarly there are other file for supporting data structures like mfset, priority queue ,etc.
5.For executing code go to main and comlpile and run that file the code will show output for both the algorithms.
